# RelTR: Relational Transformer for Scene Graph Generation

This repo is based on the implementation of the code by original author with small develpoments in GUI using tkinter 

Original Project: https://github.com/yrcong/RelTR

Relational Transformer model is a deep learning architecture that uses a transformer-based approach to generate a scene graph, which is a structured representation of objects and their relationships in a visual scene. 

The architecture consists of two main components: an object detection module and a relation prediction module. The object detection module is responsible for identifying objects in an input image and extracting their features, while the relation prediction module generates the edges between the objects and predicts their relationship type.
